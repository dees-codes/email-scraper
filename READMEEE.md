# email-scraper

Scrapes emails from a given website including those from links within the website.

It asks for a url, extracts email from the html page in the url and also extracts the emails from the child urls in the page. This process is done until 9 url's (or as many as you want to) are accessed. Regex is used to find emails in the html code of the page. Finally, all the emails that were found are printed.
